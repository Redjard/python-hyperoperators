# Hyperoperators

`hyperop` is a small library for representing ridiculously large numbers in python. It does so using [hyperoperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation).

+ Hyperoperation 1 is addition
+ Hyperoperation 2 is multiplication (repeated addition)
+ Hyperoperation 3 is exponentiation (repeated multiplication)
+ Hyperoperation 4 is tetration (repeated exponentiation)
+ ...
+ Hyperoperation n is repeated Hyperoperation (n-1)
